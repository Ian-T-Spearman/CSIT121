                        This was an incredible way to cap off the final stretch of the semester with this class, I must say!
                        During this project I was forced to challenge myself and dig deep to bring everything together. I needed
                        to harness so many of the things I learned so far during this class to finish. Flexbox, proper anchor tags, tables,
                        media queries, importing images, there's too much to list.

                        
                        <br><br>

                        I didn't have the greatest time using flexbox for the first time during lab05, so I found myself avoiding it in subsequent labs. 
                        However, for this final project I knew I wasn't going to be able to get away with that because of how much more complex it needed to be.
                        So I dug up my notes on how to use it, and I must say I was surprised and how much better it was to use the second time around! It wasn't 
                        perfect, but I did't have the hair-ripping experience of my first go around. There were some things that I wasn't able to get to work
                        properly that I wanted to implement, such as javascript to go along with the media query for mobile devices, but that's okay.
                        I meticulously tested how my website worked with the media query after every major step, and I focused on getting the layout down before
                        I put any content in, as I knew that if done the other way around things would get messed up and become a major headache. I initially had
                        problems when testing on different sized phones with the developer tools, but I found that the problem was rooted in me not declaring proper
                        widths for my flexbox container. I tend to forget when I already have widths set on other elements in CSS and it will make things conflict, leading
                        to more headaches. However I am quicker about recognizing these problems than I was at the start so that is good progress!

                        <br><br>

                        Overall in this semester I learned so much about web development, but I still feel like I barely know anything, if that makes sense.
                        It feels like I have only scratched the surface but I enjoyed coding these projects much more than I thought I would. If you had told me 
                        even just a year ago that I would be able to make these kinds of websites I would have laughed at you. I find myself often "looking under the hood"
                        for a lot of websites that I go to, just to see how they are laid out and see if I can glean anything from them. I remember a long time ago accidentally
                        pressing inspect element and just having my eyes obliterated by the influx of information, but I can easily read from it now!! I don't know if I 
                        am interested in front-end development as a career path, but the understandning of websites will be invaluable for me as I progress in the tech field, 
                        so I must thank you for the awesome class!
