    <p>
        Creating a Responsive Layout was quite challenging for this project, and I had a difficult time getting it to work. I think part of my
        problem was that I copied the inital layout of this project from Lab03 as per the instructions, and when following the guides and notes I 
        would get confused on what my layout was and what is was eventually going to be. I dabbled with both flexbox and grids, but in the end I
        ended up sticking with flexbox because I had an easier time getting that to work (haha!). I will say the elation that I had when I finally
        got my layout to work for both mobile and desktop is a rare feeling indeed, there's nothing quite like it!

    <h3>My Thoughts on Best Design Practices</h3>

            Best Design practices can be difficult to follow, however they are important rules to adhere to if you want your websites
            to be successful. There are a myriad of different devices, all with different screens, that can connect to your webpage.
            Speaking from experience, when on mobile and the site doesn't have a mobile-friendly design, it is absolutely terrible to use.
            Being able to quickly and easily navigate between the important pages, as well as having a physical color scheme that is 
            easy on the eyes is important as well. During this project I had to take breaks at multiple points because of the pain the bright
            pages would cause my eyes. I strive to have a coherent hierarchy of my content, utilizing headers and various other elements to 
            give my page the most effective design that I can.

        I learned during this project multiple ways to create layouts for webpages, using flexbox, grids, and media queries to shape the page 
        under certain conditions such as mobile vs desktop, or even tablets.

        <div class="flex-item-left">
    <p>Creating my first website with HTML was an interesting, albeit intimidating, experience. I knew nothing of
        web development or what went on under the hood of websites, but after reading the module and looking at 
        the external resources, it makes a lot more sense. Things are very logical, and structure is king. All of
        the content of a site can be likened to multiple matryoshka dolls standing next to each other, working in tandem.
        Working through the code and using the tricks that were taught in class, and also learned from the website, as well as using the validator to 
        correct the many mistakes that I missed proved to be very satisfying work and quite enjoyable!

            Additionally, I also started learning the basics of CSS. It is certainly much nicer being able to modify the html that I have written, and adding some color 
            to what would otherwise be a droll black and white document. Although I didn't use an exceptionally diverse set of modifications, I did learn 
            how to incorporate css from an external document, as well as internally embedding it within the document
            itself. I also tried to avoid adding the css modifications directly into the elements with an inline style. Apparently it is 
            hard to keep things consistent, and it loses the advantages of using a style sheet.

        <ol>
            <li>White space does not matter for HTML, which is similar to other markup languages, like XML. </li>
            <li>The difference between semantic elements and non-semantic elements: Semantic clearly defines its content, while Non-Semantic does not!</li>
            <li>You must define the language for your HTML document, and you must also make sure that you are using the correct character encoding. Otherwise
                the document will not know for sure how to correctly display the characters that you write, leading to unintended side effects (bugs).  
            </li>
            <li>Attention to detail is very important! Sometimes things will not work and you won't know why, which happened to me. When I was creating the 
                links for the websites that helped me, I accidentally had it written so that my copyright was included in the hyperlink and I couldn't figure out why.
                It wasn't until I looked through the line letter to letter that I saw that I forgot to close the 
                a href=""  tag.
            </li>
            <li>Footer tags must never be placed after the body tag!</li>
