                 In this lab I needed to find a website to evaluate the design of, and how good the user interface and user experience 
                 is/was for people who actively use the website. Overall a lot of fun as I was able to choose a site that I use often
                 that I find very useful. I did find however, that the accessibility rating was quite low. I would not have thought that 
                 op.gg would score like that, as I and many other people I know use it without a problem.

                        This was probably the most fun lab of the entire semester, and I thoroughly enjoyed putting together a table for my tierlist!
                        I also created a survey, and dabbled in javascript for the first time, managing to get the script to work with my survey. It was 
                        immensely satisfying when I finally got it to work!
