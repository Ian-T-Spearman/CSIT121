        <h3> My experience with this project</h3>
    <p>Creating my first website with HTML was an interesting, albeit intimidating, experience. I knew nothing of
        web development or what went on under the hood of websites, but after reading the module and looking at 
        the external resources, it makes a lot more sense. Things are very logical, and structure is king. All of
        the content of a site can be likened to multiple matryoshka dolls standing next to each other, working in tandem.
        Working through the code and using the tricks that were taught in class, and also learned from the website, as well as using the validator to 
        correct the many mistakes that I missed proved to be very satisfying work and quite enjoyable!

        <h3>My thoughts on css</h3>
        <p>
            Additionally, I also started learning the basics of CSS. It is certainly much nicer being able to modify the html that I have written, and adding some color 
            to what would otherwise be a droll black and white document. Although I didn't use an exceptionally diverse set of modifications, I did learn 
            how to incorporate css from an external document, as well as internally embedding it within the document
            itself. I also tried to avoid adding the css modifications directly into the elements with an inline style. Apparently it is 
            hard to keep things consistent, and it loses the advantages of using a style sheet.

    <h3 id="list1">Things that I learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>White space does not matter for HTML, which is similar to other markup languages, like XML. </li>
            <li>The difference between semantic elements and non-semantic elements: Semantic clearly defines its content, while Non-Semantic does not!</li>
            <li>You must define the language for your HTML document, and you must also make sure that you are using the correct character encoding. Otherwise
                the document will not know for sure how to correctly display the characters that you write, leading to unintended side effects (bugs).  
            </li>
            <li>Attention to detail is very important! Sometimes things will not work and you won't know why, which happened to me. When I was creating the 
                links for the websites that helped me, I accidentally had it written so that my copyright was included in the hyperlink and I couldn't figure out why.
                It wasn't until I looked through the line letter to letter that I saw that I forgot to close the 
                a href=""  tag.
            </li>
            <li>Footer tags must never be placed after the body tag!</li>
        </ol>
