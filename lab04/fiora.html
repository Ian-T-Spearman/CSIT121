            <h3>Description</h3>
            
            <p>
                This is Fiora hitting her signature pose, demonstrating her quick reflexes and adept swordsmanship by 
                catching a rose petal on the side of her blade!

            </p>
           
            <h3>.png File type</h3>
            <p>
    
                The picture above uses the .png filetype, which is short for Portable Network Graphic. More modern than JPEG, it supports millions 
                of colors, transparency, lossless compression, and is supported by modern browsers.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Fiora?</h3>
            <p>
                Fiora is my favorite champion, and one that I have been playing for a long time. She has a very mobile playstyle
                and is the kind of character that likes to get in your face and deal damage! In the lore she is such a good swordsman that she 
                will call out what direction she will attack you from, and then hit you there, leaving you unable to counter!
