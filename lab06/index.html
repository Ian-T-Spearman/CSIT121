    <h3 id="h3_id3">    Who is the site's target audience?   </h3>
        <p>
            The websites primary audience are active community members and players of the League of Legends community, who value a competitive 
            look into useful statistics pertaining to the game itself, user profiles, and active games that users may be in, giving vital 
            information before you start a match.

<article>
    <h3 id="h3_id4">     How is the site organized?  </h3>
        <p>
            Op.gg is organized in a hierarchical manner, with a clear home page and a crisp navigation bar at the top, allowing for fast navigation. 
            There is a large, easily visible search bar in the center of the page for users to look up their accounts. Once on your account page, there 
            is an additional nav bar which will guide you to more specific pages, such as: past season placements, champion statistics (Kill/death ratios), 
            recently played matches, type of game-mode played, and more.

    <h3 id="h3_id5"> Which CRAP Design Principle does the use? Provide at least one example.  </h3>
    <p>
        Op.gg Utilizes Proximity quite well, and has an effective centered layout that gives the reader an immediate view of the important 
        things you would be looking for.  Your rank and win-rate are in clear view, with the recently played games in a separate box directly to 
        the right of it. The site uses proximity to create a flow that your eyes follow, with related items being separate but playing off each other well.

    <h3 id="h3_id6">    What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker   </h3>
    <p>
        The audit scores an abysmal 57 out of 100, with websites being at risk of accessibility lawsuits at lower than 90. 
        It mainly loses points from a few critical issues, mostly dealing with people with vision related disabilities, including
        blindness, low-vision, and colorblindness.

<article>
    <h3 id="h3_id7">     What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?  </h3>
    <p>
        The site is very effective at what its supposed to do. You can almost instantly view your current stats, as well as past seasons 
        stats with just a few clicks of your mouse. If you are currently in a game it will show you pertinent stats about you and the other players 
        in the match, and because it interacts with the game companies API, it is highly accurate.

<article>
    <h3 id="h3_id8">     What is the site's efficiency? Can users can perform tasks quickly?  </h3>
    <p>
        The site has great efficiency, as the hierarchal structure allows for a fast and easy browsing experience, with clear 
        labels and headings that allow you to navigate to the exact part of the website that you desire. To get to anywhere that you would need to go, it requires
        no more than 3 clicks.

<article>
    <h3 id="h3_id9"> How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?  </h3>
    <p>
        The websites engagement stays mostly on topic, with most of its information pertaining to League of Legends and statistics that would interest a player. 
        It does have various other links at the very top of the site that might interest a player, such as esports or a desktop application download.  However, these 
        are just a small part that are not very noticeable for most users (I didnt see this until I was prompted to look for this assignment).

<article>
    <h3 id="h3_id10"> Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.  </h3>
    <p>
        If I had to give one suggestion, it would be to create more of a contrast on the user pages. The background used to be darker, but they 
        changed it in an update a while ago to only be a slightly darker grey, which in my opinion makes it a bit harder to read.
