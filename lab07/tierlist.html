<h3>What I learned:</h3>
<p>During this assignment I learned a lot on how to make forms and tables work, and it was honestly not as hard as I thought it was going to be going into it. One of the 
    main difficulties that I ran into when dealing with my survey was getting the JavaScript to work. I was unaware that I had to create an id for every input, so when the script would
    run it could parse the code and retrieve the elements. I also had to figure out how to translate which of my elements would fit with the code, and initially it didn't work. 
    In order to get it to work, I looked through the original code and saw which element-type corresponded to which piece of code, and filled it out appropriately. For the tierlist, 
    I wanted to try and make the border around the headers thicker, but unfortunately I couldn't get it to work without it looking off and making the entire table's border thicker.
    I had a lot of help from the videos linked in the module, they were so helpful! Something about seeing it in action helps it stick with me better than just reading off a thread.
