            <h3>Description: Why League of Legends?</h3>
            
            <p>I wanted to talk about something I am passionate about, what else but my favorite game!
                In League of Legends, or LoL for short, you play on a Massive Online Battle Arena as characters
                called 'Champions'. What role and champions you play says a lot about you as a player, which made me 
                want to talk about the champion pool that I use.

            </p>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>
                I learned a lot during this project, mainly about the use of CSS and how to format images, as well as borders. Learning
                how to align specific headings to the center, and shifting the borders to the center as well. It was quite the headache trying to figure out 
                exactly what I was doing wrong, as once you have so many lines of code, it can get confusing! At one point I was on the wrong nav stylesheet, wondering
                why my Nav bar wasn't responding to the 'display:inline' command, but I figured it out. I also learned to MAKE BACKUPS FREQUENTLY. Halfway through my project
                I had accidentally forgotten to save, and had to start from scratch, which was quite frustrating.
            
            </p>
