            <h2>Why is SPARQL important? </h2>

            <p>SPARQL is the standardized way that RDF data is queried across the Semantic Web. Without a consistent method of querying data, it would limit the 
                ability of different organizations to share and link their data together, greatly hindering the interoperability of various systems. In particular, 
            SPARQL excels at querying data in a way that is optimal for machine-reading, thus greatly increasing the efficiency at which AI can use said data. </p>

            <h2>How does SPARQL compare to SQL?</h2>

            <p>While they are both query languages, SPARQL and SQL differ greatly in the types of data they query and the methodology that they use. SQL
                is much more rigid in the data it queries, it must read from tables and rows. SPARQL uses RDF which defines data as a graph, with the information
                linked as triples.
