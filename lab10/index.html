            <h2>What is SPARQL? </h2>

            <p>SPARQL (pronounced as "sparkle"), is short for SPARKQL Protocol and RDF Query Language, and it is a query language used in conjuction with data stored
                using the RDF format. It works by utilizing two HTTP operations: GET and POST. The former sends a query request to the particular database that it is using,
            while the latter actually performs the output of the parameters that were set in the initial query. </p>

            <h2>What are Query Languages?</h2>

            <p>In computing, one of the most important assets that you can obtain is data. Without data there is no way to anaylze or extrapolate meaning from
                the various inputs and outputs that are required; there is no way to learn or improve upon things. This is where databases come in, as a structured
                way to organize and categorize the vast amounts of data that is collected in the modern era. The problem with databases comes from the sheer amount of data 
                they contain, which is where Query Languages come into play. Query Languages are used as an interface between the user and the databases, allowing the two to interact.
                They make specific searches in databases based off the specific variables that you input, narrowing down the information to that which is most pertinent to the user.

            <h2>RDF</h2>

            <p>RDF, or Resource Description Framework is a standard model that excels in data integration from multiple sources, allowing for optimal Queries
                across multiple databases. RDF has excellent machine readability, and is flexible in how the data can be defined. It utilizes a system in 
                which it links data together in three instances sequentially: Subject, Predicate, and Object.
