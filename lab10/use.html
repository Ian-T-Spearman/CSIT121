            <h2>What can you use SPARQL for? </h2>

            <p>SPARQL is mainly used for complex querying across RDF datasets, which includes filtering results, aggregating data, and combining different datasets.
                Although this is the main function of SPARQL, it can also be used update RDF databases and change the data that is stored, which is useful for more dynamic
                datasets. While also being very useful for machine learning, SPARQL is useful for linking data across datasets, which can allow for queries from different places
                on the web at the same time.

            <h2>Main types of Queries: </h2>

            <p>
                There are many different types of queries available to use in SPARQL, however the most commonly used are:
            </p>

            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>SELECT: Select matches found in a data graph.</li>
                    <li>ASK: Ask if there is a match found in the dataset from the query.</li>
                    <li>CONSTRUCT: Create new data from the existing data.</li>
                    <li>DESCRIBE:Creates an RDF graph that 'Describes' the data.</li>
                </ol>
                
            </div>

            <h2>SPARQL Query Example </h2>

            <div>
            <p>SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
                <br>WHERE {
                  ?subject ?predicate ?object .
                }
            </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    This is the template for a basic query, which when filled out would look something like:<br>
                    SELECT ?personName ?cityName
                    <br>WHERE {
                      ?person rdf:type ex:Person .
                      ?person ex:hasName ?personName .
                      ?city ex:hasName ?cityName.  
                    }
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    This query searches the data and finds matches based off the links between 'Person' and 'City'.
                </p>
            </div>
